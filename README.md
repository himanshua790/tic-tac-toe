# tic-tac-toe
Assesment/Task for the postion of Software Developer at LetsEndorse

I'll be working on Backend Task and if I have some extra time left, I would work on Full-stack task also.

## Backend Task:
- Replicate the Google Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Url for reference: https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe
- Make it in such a way that it can be integrated with a frontend.
- First the user should be able to choose Start New Match or Join Match.
- If Join match is chosen, you need to enter the match id (random generated 5 character).
- If New match is chosen, ask the user to choose the match type: Vs Player or Vs Computer.
- When Vs Computer is chosen, the computer should try to win the game.

**Deal breaker: If you cannot create a frontend UI after completing the backend in the given time.**

*Tech stack to be used: Node JS*

## Full-stack Task:

- Replicate the Google Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- Url for reference: https://www.google.com/search?q=tic+tac+toe
- First the user should be able to choose Start New Match or Join Match.
- If Join match is chosen, you need to enter the match id (random generated 5 character).
- If New match is chosen, ask the user to choose the match type: Vs Player or Vs Computer.
- When Vs Computer is chosen, the computer should try to win the game.

**Deal breaker: If you cannot host the application on a server and provide the url to see it working live.**

*Tech stack to be used: React JS, Node JS*
